      <p>Greetings,</p> 
      <p> We all look for new beginnings and this is a small picture into mine. As a recent graduate of University of Riversides Full Stack Web developer bootcamp, I gained the ability to create frontend and backend applications.  During this period, I have gained expertise in these areas: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Materialize, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MySql, Firebase, Mongo, Mongoose, Heroku, and Sequelize. <p>
      <p> As stated earlier, this is my new beginning. After 34 Â½ years, I recently retired from IBM. This is an important point, because during that period of my life valuable skills were gained and used in implementing several successful projects. Those skills were in Technical Project Management, System Management, IT Architect, with a focus on Active Directory design and implementation.<p> 
      <p>By combining these new skills with those recently gained, I will be an excellent addition to any team and project. <p>
